# OWON AG 1022 Direct USB Driver

This folder contains a working direct USB driver for the OWON AG 1022 signal generator that appears as "usb device" under "libusb-win32 devices" in Device Manager.

## üéØ Overview

The OWON AG 1022 signal generator uses a generic USB interface that doesn't work with standard VISA communication. This driver bypasses VISA entirely and communicates directly with the USB device using `pyusb`.

### ‚úÖ What Works
- **Device Detection**: Automatically finds OWON AG 1022 devices
- **Setting Commands**: FREQ, VOLT, FUNC, OUTP (all work reliably)
- **Signal Generation**: Full control over frequency, voltage, waveform, and output
- **VNA Integration**: Ready to use with Vector Network Analyzer software

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
- **Query Commands**: FREQ?, VOLT?, FUNC?, OUTP? timeout (common with this device)
- **Device Tracking**: Driver maintains internal state since queries don't work

## üìñ API Reference

### OWONAG1022Simple Class

#### Constructor
```python
OWONAG1022Simple(vendor_id=None, product_id=None)
```
- `vendor_id`: USB vendor ID (default: 0x5345)
- `product_id`: USB product ID (default: 0x1234)

#### Methods

##### Frequency Control
```python
set_frequency(frequency)  # Set frequency in Hz (0.1 to 20M)
get_frequency()          # Get current frequency (cached)
```

##### Voltage Control
```python
set_voltage(voltage)     # Set voltage in V (0.01 to 20)
get_voltage()           # Get current voltage (cached)
```

##### Waveform Control
```python
set_waveform(waveform)   # Set waveform ("SIN", "SQU", "TRI", "RAMP")
get_waveform()          # Get current waveform (cached)
```

##### Output Control
```python
set_output(enabled)     # Enable/disable output
get_output()           # Get output status (cached)
```

##### Utility Methods
```python
configure_signal(freq, volt, waveform, enable_output)  # Configure all at once
test_communication()   # Test basic communication
close()               # Clean up and close connection
```

#### Context Manager
```python
with OWONAG1022Simple() as device:
    device.set_frequency(1000)
    device.set_output(True)
    # Device automatically closed when exiting context
```

## üîç Device Detection

### Automatic Detection
```python
from owon_ag1022_simple import find_owon_devices

devices = find_owon_devices()
for vid, pid, manufacturer, product in devices:
    print(f"Found: {manufacturer} {product} (VID: 0x{vid:04x}, PID: 0x{pid:04x})")
```

### Manual Device Selection
```python
# Use specific vendor/product IDs
device = OWONAG1022Simple(vendor_id=0x5345, product_id=0x1234)
```

## üîå VNA Integration

### Basic Integration
```python
from owon_ag1022_simple import OWONAG1022Simple

class MyVNA:
    def __init__(self):
        self.signal_gen = OWONAG1022Simple()
    
    def sweep_frequency(self, start_freq, stop_freq, num_points):
        frequencies = np.linspace(start_freq, stop_freq, num_points)
        results = []
        
        for freq in frequencies:
            self.signal_gen.set_frequency(freq)
            # Take VNA measurement here
            # results.append(measurement_data)
        
        return results
```

### Advanced Integration Example
See `vna_integration_example.py` for a complete VNA integration example.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found
1. **Check USB Connection**: Ensure device is connected and powered on
2. **Check Device Manager**: Device should appear under "libusb-win32 devices"
3. **Try Different USB Port**: Some ports may not work properly
4. **Restart Device**: Power cycle the signal generator

### Communication Errors
1. **Check pyusb Installation**: `pip install pyusb`
2. **Check Device Busy**: Close other applications using the device
3. **Check USB Cables**: Try different USB cables
4. **Check Drivers**: Ensure libusb-win32 driver is installed

### Query Timeouts
- **Normal Behavior**: Query commands (FREQ?, VOLT?, etc.) timeout on this device
- **Use Cached Values**: The driver maintains internal state for get_* methods
- **Use Setting Commands**: All set_* commands work reliably

### Permission Errors
1. **Run as Administrator**: Try running Python as administrator
2. **Check USB Permissions**: May need to grant USB access permissions
3. **Close Other Applications**: Ensure no other software is using the device
